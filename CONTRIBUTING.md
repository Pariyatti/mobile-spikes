## Overview

- highlight long-term view, selfless service


## Long-term Support

It is important for all contributors to keep in mind the nature of Pariyatti projects. 2500 years of literature is likely to experience a very long software support cycle --- rather unlike those seen in common software projects. (Some help conceptualizing this exponential timescale is provided in the following section, "Time".) For this reason, a key point must always be kept in mind:

> Always defer to long-term Pariyatti staff for any major decision and for the ultimate responsibility of stewardship of artefacts.

"Artefacts" here refers both to the physical and the digital. Examples of very important long-term artefacts include things like: email accounts, web service accounts, passwords, security keys, and privacy-sensitive documents. Always provide access to such artefacts to multiple Pariyatti staff members to limit bus factor and reduce friction.

In addition to the stewardship of artefacts, we as contributors to Pariyatti software must consider how our design, technical, and architectural decisions affect the longevity of what we create. Preference will generally be given to stable, high-quality tools with broad (preferably open) support across varying systems and geographies. Some examples are provided below, in the section "Tool Choices".


## Time

The normal timescales of a standard software project remain extant in Pariyatti software projects: Initial development will happen in iterations --- some perhaps as short as one week, some perhaps as long as multiple months. Continued development, in the standard open source model, will proceed on the order of years. Along with this, maintenance will occur over a time period of years-to-decades.

Beyond this, however, we must imagine the longer timescales on which this software will continue to live. In the coming decades, computing devices and software methods will both change greatly and Pariyatti software must change with them. Computing itself is a relatively young discipline but already "software archeology" exists as a sub-discipline. It will be helpful if we anticipate these longer timescales and contextualize our contributions to Pariyatti by planning for the times after our contributions (and lives) are finished --- and who will steward our contributions after we are no longer here to guide them.

Whether choosing a hardware platform, an operating system, a service provider, a shrink-wrapped software package, or a programming language/framework, always take a moment to consider the various exponential timescales within which that choice must survive.


## Naming

> There are two hard problems in Computer Science: (1) Cache Invalidation and (2) Naming Things.

It will be very important to converge on meaningful and universally-understood names for all layers of Pariyatti's software architecture. To prevent confusion it will be helpful for all contributors (users, project managers, operations staff, designers, and developers) to share a common language. To this end, each project may have a `GLOSSARY.md` in its root directory. We may also choose to produce a glossary which is global to all projects.
