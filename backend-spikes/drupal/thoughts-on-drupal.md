Both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 are projected to reach end of life around September 2021.

I feel it is much better to go with Drupal 8.8 which is the most recent version. According to the official announcements it is going to be an easier migration to Drupal 9.

I cannot help but compare Drupal 7 to Express.js or Sinatra and Drupal 8 to Rails or Django.

## Questions

I know we are leaning towards Drupal 7. Hence a few questions:

* What happens at Drupal 7 end-of-life?
* What are the specific Drupal 7 modules we need that Drupal 8 does not support?

## Drupal 7

* Released in 2011
* Reaching end of life in 2021
* Security updates will stop coming in the future
* Quiet barebones, needs a lot of modules to be installed to get started
* Lightweight, cached pages get served faster for anonymous users
* Needs lot of modules to even get to basic functionality
* Has a lot of powerful modules in the ecosystem
* Content editing cannot be done directly from UI (without modules)
* Basic things like Views, Revisions, Alternative URL paths require modules
* WYSIWYG Editor not present by default, Inline editing not enabled

## Drupal 8

* Released in 2015
* Reaching end of life in 2021
* Depends on Sympony framework for backend
* Depends on Twig framework for Themes
* Easy migration to Drupal 9 if deprecated APIs are not used
* Admin Panel has more features and a much better UX
* **WYSIWYG Editor** for new pages and posts
* Inline content editing is directly enabled
* Views are core components - can be easily customized
* Responsive support ( but drops support for IE 6, 7, 8)
* Multilingual features - language, content, interface and translation
* Core is quite functional by default - Views, Revisions, Alternative URL Path
* Picture is one of the included modules
* REST APIs
* Creates proper metadata, schema.org markup and links e.g. 'mailto:' and 'tel:'
* Theme language provided by Twig for CSS and preprocessor funtions
* Out of the box, Drupal 8 installs the following modules: Automated Cron, Bartik, Block, Breakpoint, CKEditor, Classy, Color, Comment, Configuration Manager, Contact, Contextual Links, Custom Block, Custom Menu Links, Database Logging, Datetime, Field, Field UI, File, Filter, Help, History, Image, Internal Dynamic Page Cache, Internal Page Cache, Link, Menu UI, Node, Options, Path, Quick Edit, RDF, Search, Seven, Shortcut, Stable, Standard, System, Taxonomy, Text, Text Editor, Toolbar, Tour, Update Manager, User, Views, and Views UI.
